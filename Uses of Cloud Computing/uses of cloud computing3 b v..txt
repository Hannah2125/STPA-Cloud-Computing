<p>Cloud computing is a plan that allows for convenient on demand network access that is shared by programmable resources such as servers, networks, or applications. To be considered one a cloud computing system, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) then it must have a required five characteristics. These are on-demand self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. There are also three service models that fall into the cloud computing model and these are Software as a Service which allows the consumer to run applications through the cloud infrastructure though their control is limited over the configuration settings and Platform as a Service which allows the consumer to use applications on the cloud infrastructure and while the consumer does not have control of the cloud network it does have that ability over the applications deployed. The last one is the Infrastructure as Services, which gives the consumer the ability to access the networks, run operating systems, and run arbitrary software. The consumer still cannot control the cloud infrastructure but has control over the operating system. There are five possible deployment models. The private cloud allows an organization that is made up of multiple businesses and can be operated, managed and owned by the organization. The community cloud is made for the use for a group of consumers that share a common concern such as policy. The public cloud allows for use of the general public and can be owned by even the government and only exists in a certain area, such as a school. The final cloud is a hybrid cloud that is made up of two or more of the previous models that work separately but allows for software to be transferred from one cloud to another. 1
Cloud computing allows for the use of virtualized resources on the internet and will have a large effect on the educational system in the future. It provides a great alternative for schools and universities that have a tight budget to be able to operate their information systems without having to spend more per device.  Many universities take advantage of cloud-based applications offered by their service providers which in turn allow for students to perform scholastic and business tasks.

Backup:

Backing up information is a time-consuming and complicated process. You would have to do many tedious things just to make sure your data is backed up. Instead of doing these complex things, you can use cloud. Cloud computing allows you to automatically transmit data without worrying about capacity, security, nor availability.

File Storage:

This is one of the most major uses of cloud computing. Cloud Computing allows you to store your files from any web enabled interface. At any location and time, you have speed, security, and availability. Businesses only pay for the storage you are using, so you don’t have to worry constantly about storage infrastructure.

Disaster Recovery:

Businesses often experience difficult situations with disaster recovery. This is a where cloud computing comes in. With cloud computing, disaster recovery is cheaper, faster and effective compared to the expensive, stiff procedures.
