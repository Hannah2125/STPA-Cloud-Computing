    America made a mass orbiter called the Mars Observer designed to probe Mars' surface and atmosphere for one martian year (687 days). A radiosytem, computers, fuel tanks, and tape recorders were some of the equipment on this bus. Scientists planned to map the gravity field of the red planet. In 1993, 11 months after the launch, it fell silent. Even now there is no determination as to why this happened.

    This next orbiter, MGS, was an extremely successful mission. Of course every mission has some fails, including this one. After launching one of the orbiter's solar panels unfolded, but didn't lock. This would haunt engineers later on. It's good that the engines worked fine. It began aerobraking, which causes tension on solar panels. The engineers found a way to not break the solar panels, but now results in the mission being one year longer. The MGS returned in 2001 and brought much more iformation on the red planet.

    Russia launched a lander named Mars 96 but never left the atmosphere due to a crash land in the Pacific.

    ISAS had launched many satellites by this time. Nozomi would be their first interplanet probe. This would be challenging. It's objective was to study the structure of the upper martian atmosphere and how its affected by solarwind. They thought that this would help solve how mars lost it's liquid water. The 5 year journey was originally scheduled to be 15 months.

    The Mars Climate Orbiter rocket uses main engine to slow its speed to enter the orbit. The MCO passed behind Mars as the engine burn happened expectantly.  Up to that time, the information thry acquired from the spacecraft looked ordinary.  Sadly, the signal couldn't be found by the flight controllers.

    On March 7, 2001, an orbiter called the Mars Odyssey was launched to reach the Red Planet. This orbiter turned out to be a record- breaking machine.  In 2010, it was rewarded as the longes-serving-piece to work at Mars.  It has returned over 350,000 images of the Red Planet.

    The Euopean Space Agency launched Mars Express on June 2nd of 2003. Mars Express completed it's mission in November of 2005 and extended it's mission. On December 25, 2003, the lander was lost upon it's arrival.

    Opportunity and Sprit, some of NASA's two rovers, were sent to go to Mar's surface in 2004. They both provided evidence of water once being on the planet. In 2010 though, Spirit was caught in a sand dune. But in good news, Opportunity is still in the works.

    NASA's orbiter, Mars Reonniassance Orbiter, was launched and provided daata that has 3,500 radar observations and 25,000 images. It has returned more data than any previous missions combined.

    On 2013 in India, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) was launched. The Mars Orbiter was to explore Mar's outer appearence, atmosphere, and mineralogy. Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution also was launched in the U.S. It was to examnate the atmosphere. Both were a success.
