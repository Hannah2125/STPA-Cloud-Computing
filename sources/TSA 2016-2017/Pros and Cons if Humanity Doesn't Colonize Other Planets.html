Positive impacts: One of the many positive impacts on not living on Mars is that another planet might affect the human body negatively.  Research shows that even getting to the planet might cause humans muscle atrophy and maybe even osteoprosis.  For astronauts, after being in zero gravity for long periods of time it is hard to adjust to Earth's gravity.  Mars' gravity is 38% of Earth's which in the long run will cause weakened bones and cells.  Another positive impact is not having to deal with the erratic weather.  Mars has a thin atmosphere which results in very frigid weather.  The ranges can go from 125 degrees celcius at the poles to 20 degrees celcius at the equator.  Humans would have to constantly wear gear just to survive daily weather.

Negative impacts:  If humans would never colonize another planet, we humans will overpopulate this planet.  Our pexistance as a species would be put to an end if we don't have enough resources we could clearly get from another planet.  That will help continue our legacy.  Another con about this is that if we didn't populate Mars we won't grow as a species.
